# Zero2Cloud LOGBOOK

## 2026-01-19
**Win:** Fixed Git identity + made first clean commit ✅  
**Commit:** 136b6c2 - NetCheck: add Windows network + Zero2Cloud header  
**Notes:** Getting tired but stayed consistent. Also had an idea about the 3-6-9 digital root pattern.
**Next:** Push repo to GitHub + start mini project: digital_root_369

2026-01-22 — Linux+ Days 1–3 (Permissions / PATH / sudo)

Ran daily NetCheck and reviewed newest log.

Installed and used tree to visualize folder structure (super helpful).

Linux+ Day 2: created run.sh, learned chmod +x, ran script with ./run.sh.

Learned ./ = run a file from the current directory, not search PATH.

Linux+ Day 3: learned alias vs real binary path:

type ls → alias

which ls → /usr/bin/ls

echo $PATH understood command search order

Confirmed privilege change: whoami vs sudo whoami → pharr → root

✅ Mood: big-picture Linux is starting to click.
